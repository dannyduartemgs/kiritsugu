Kiritsugu Emiya from Fate Zero as a skin for Driver


Sorry for the low quality, that was the only model I could find, but I really like this character so it had to be done.

My first attemp at making skins for modded characters, I have 2 more skins planned for Driver: Big Boss and Leon S. Kennedy.
